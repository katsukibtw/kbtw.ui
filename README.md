kbtw.ui is a lightweight React UI library made to be used in small projects (especially in my own ones).

It's designed to be easy to install without hundreds of additional dependencies and be as fast as possible.

### Design

Most parts of the design for this library are inspired by [Joy UI](https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/) and [Google Material Design 3 (Material You)](https://m3.material.io/). Selected colors are perfect for creating sleek and minimal web applications.

### Types

Typescript ready, with this library you wont face any problems with types in React + TS projects.

### No dependencies

kbtw.ui does not use any kind of supplemental styling libraries, such as [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), etc. Written in pure React + Typescript, it's very easy to use in small projects

## Usage

As for now, package for this library is not published to npm, so if you want to use it, you need to clone this repository, build the library and link it to your project.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/katsukibtw/kbtw.ui.git && cd kbtw.ui
pnpm i
pnpm build
pnpm link --global
```
